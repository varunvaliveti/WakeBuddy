## Project Description

**WakeBuddy** is a unique personal alarm app that uses a bit of tough love to make sure you stay punctual and on top of your schedule.
This alarm app lacks a snooze button so you can never unconciously give yourself 5 more minutes. Instead, it uses of a collection
of fun tasks that you can do to turn off the alarm. These tasks can range from a short Physical activity to a quick Math problem. 
  
**WakeBuddy's** goal is to make waking up a fun and interactive game!
